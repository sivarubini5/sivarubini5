# Hi there 👋, I'm Sivarubini Uthamaraj

## 👩‍🎓 About Me

As an **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** student, I realized early on that the power of technology isn’t just in intelligent systems — it’s in the ability to bring those systems to life through well-built applications.  

That’s why I joined **NxtWave’s CCBP 4.0 Academy** in my first year, diving into full-stack development with the **MERN stack** to build real-world web apps from the ground up.

I expanded my skill set by completing a **UI/UX internship at Next Skill Technologies**, where I learned to create user-centric designs that align seamlessly with the backend.

By combining my technical background in AI with a deep understanding of design and development, I now build full-stack solutions that aren’t just functional but intuitive and user-focused.
